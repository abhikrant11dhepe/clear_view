## Overview

The AI-ML-based system for indoor fire hazard rescue operations is a powerful tool designed to enhance the effectiveness of rescue teams in scenarios where smoke and haze are major obstacles. This system utilizes real-time video processing, machine learning, and user-friendly interfaces to provide a clearer view of the affected area and facilitate critical decision-making.

## Features

1. **Smoke and Haze Detection**: The system employs advanced algorithms to detect and analyze smoke and haze in real-time video streams, ensuring that the rescue team can accurately assess the situation.

2. **Image Enhancement**: Using image enhancement techniques, the system improves the visibility of the environment by reducing the impact of smoke and haze, allowing for a clearer view of the area.

3. **Object Recognition**: It identifies key objects and individuals in the video feed, helping rescue teams locate and prioritize their efforts effectively.

4. **Fire Localization**: The system pinpoints the exact location of the fire, enabling rapid response and efficient allocation of resources.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**: The system provides a user-friendly interface for rescue teams to access enhanced video feeds and receive critical alerts. It simplifies the decision-making process during high-stress situations.

6. **Continuous Machine Learning Feedback**: Machine learning models continuously adapt and improve based on real-world data, enhancing the system's accuracy and effectiveness over time.

7. **Data Storage for Analysis**: All data is securely stored for post-incident analysis, helping improve future rescue operations and providing valuable insights for training and preparedness.
